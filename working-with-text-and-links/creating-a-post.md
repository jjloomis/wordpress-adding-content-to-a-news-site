# Creating a Post

To add a story to a news site, you'll need to create a post and save and submit it for review. Your post will not be public until your instructor or editor reviews and approves your content.

1. From the Dashboard, click **Posts** and select **Add New**. 
2. Enter a title for your post.
3. Use the Visual editor to add text and media elements to your post. Use the Text editor when working with code.
4. Select a category. **Note**: Do not select a home page category (home-whatever.) Your instructor or editor will do this. 
5. Edit your URL, if necessary. 
5. To preview your post, click **Preview**. Note: This will open a new tab in your browser. Be sure to work with the original tab when making changes to your post.
5. When finished, click **Submit for Review**.
