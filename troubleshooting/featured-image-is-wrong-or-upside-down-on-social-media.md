# Featured Image is Wrong, Upside Down or Sideways on Social Media

## Image is wrong

1. 


## Image is upside down or sideways

If the image is upside down or sideways on social media, it was probably uploaded to WordPress that way and then rotated in the WordPress Edit Media window. This is fine when the the image stays within WordPress, but problems arise when Facebook refrences the original (non-rotated) version of the image.

Note: You may run into this problem even if it
looks like the image is properly rotated on your computer. Occasionally, different platforms (your phone, WordPress, your computer's operating system, etc.) will disagree on what constitutes "the bottom" of an image.
