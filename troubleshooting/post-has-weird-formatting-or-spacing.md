# Post has Weird Formatting and/or Spacing

If you post has weird formatting (text is a different size, color, etc. than you intended) or the spacing between paragraphs and images looks weird, you may have unwanted HTML in your post. 

Even though you didn't manually add this HTML yourself, you can see it in your post when you switch to the Text editor. The problematic HTML will look like this:

```
<div class="styled-paragraph">Here is some example text within a div. The div came along for the ride when this text was copied from a Google Doc, D2L, or a website.</div>
```
