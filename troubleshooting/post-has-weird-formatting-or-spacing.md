# Post has Weird Formatting and/or Spacing

If your post has weird formatting (text is a different size, color, etc. than you intended) or the spacing between paragraphs and images looks weird, you may have unwanted HTML in your post. 

Even though you didn't add this HTML on purpose, you'll see it in your post when you switch to the Text editor. 

The problematic HTML will look something like this:

```
<div class="styled-paragraph">Here is some example text within a div. The div came along for the ride when this text was copied from a Google Doc, D2L, or a website.</div>
```

HTML comes along for the ride when you copy text from a source that appears in a browser. This includes Google Docs, D2L, and almost every website on the internet.

The HTML may inlcude tags that match CSS selectors in your site's style.css file (the file that controls the look of your site.) This is what causes the weird formatting and/or spacing in your post.

## Fixing Weird Formatting and/or Spacing

1. Make sure you have your post content saved in another location (class folder, thumb drive, etc.) If you don't have your post content saved in another location, do not proceed with these instructions. 
2. In your post, switch to the Text editor. 
3. Select everything in your post. 
4. Press **Delete** (on keyboard) to delete the content of your post in the Text editor.  
5. Copy of the content 

These instructions will require you to add your media (images, MP3s, etc.) to your post again.
