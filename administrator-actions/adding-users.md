# Adding Users

Before adding users, you need to understand user roles. Assigning the wrong role to a user puts the entire site in jeopardy.

## Roles

Always give users the lowest level role they need. If you're unsure about what role a user should have, stick with Subscriber or Contributer You can always give them a higher level role later.

Don't assign an Author or Editor role to a user until they've proven themselves trustworthy in lower level roles.

The Administrator role should be given to as few users as possible. Only give this role to a user who has a excellent track record in the Editor role.
