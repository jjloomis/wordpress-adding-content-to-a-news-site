# Adding Users

## Roles

Always give users the lowest level role they need. If you're unsure about what role a user should have, stick with Subscriber or Contributer. You can always give them a higher level role later.

Never give an Author or Editor role to a user until they have proven themselves trustworthy in lower level roles.

The Administrator role should be given to as few users as possible. Only give this role to a user who has a proven track record in the Editor role.
